                    If the code has an unsolvable bug, this message appears. In case you are reading this, well boss, I
                    made
                    a mistake or you made it, or the API from which I get the data has crashed. I don't know, use the
                    menu
                    to continue browsing, if the error persists, go to the bottom and click on the GitHub icon and
                    submit an

                        Or maybe you clicked on "Goblin Slayer: Bouken Kiroku Youshi - Adventure Sheet". Shit that anime
                        appears on MyAnimeList but it doesn't give results on AniDB, it doesn't make sense. To my
                        knowledge there is this that gives a 404 (which I make a 505 error because I'm funny af)</p>

                        Or maybe idk. Bro, I don't know, I wrote this project while I had exams to take, all of this is
                        not even for commercial purposes, do you think I have the time or the funds to do a good job? do
                        you know how much to keep this stuff online? Yes, it costs little, but it still costs!

                        OR? Still looking for a reason? are you so obsessed with the truth that you want to know the
                        reason for the bug? really? Okay, keep in mind the time of the error, i'll personally screenshot
                        to you the error report. End?
